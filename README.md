# The Free Isles of Tashinori
The Free Isles of Toshinori is the name of the large archipelago that resides in the sapphire blue waters of the Antara Ocean. They became the Free Isles after an adventurer named Toshinori Zepar slayed the Hobgoblin king that controlled the vast majority of the islands. He led the conquest of the islands, but turned down being a king, giving the islands true freedom. 

The purpose of this is to populate the 41 islands with various settlements, dungeons, societies and a fair amount of pirates. Ideally, the Free Isles of Toshinori becomes a fully featured campaign setting with a deep history that anyone can pick up and play in.

More detailed instructions for how to set up the working environment to follow once they are worked out. Currently still in the process of getting the feet wet and figuring out exactly the best way to go about this.
